# Campus_News_App

## ðŸ“° Project Summary

The **Campus News App** is a collaborative project created by our team to build a web application for campus news, user management, and admin controls.  
Each member works on their own assigned feature branch, and all updates are merged into the main branch by the leader.

**Workflow Summary:**
1. Clone the repository:  
   `git clone https://github.com/febekeyt/Campus_News_App.git`
2. Create your feature branch:  
   `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
3. Do your assigned task and commit changes:  
   `git add .`  
   `git commit -m "your message"`
4. Push your branch:  
   `git push origin feature/your-feature-name`
5. Create a pull request on GitHub.  
6. The leader (Phoebe) reviews and merges to `main`.  
7. After merging, all members pull the latest updates:  
   `git pull origin main`

This process ensures organized teamwork, avoids conflicts, and keeps the project updated for everyone.
